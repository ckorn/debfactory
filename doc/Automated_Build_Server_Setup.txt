This document describes how to setup an automated build server using the 
debfactory scripts.

We will use anomymous FTP to receive the source files to be build.
vsftpd was selected because it is a main package, most likely to have security updates on a timely manner.
	sudo apt-get install vsftpd

Now we need to tweak the configuration file because we will need to accept 
anonymous ftp uploads for the packages, edit /etc/vsftpd.conf and apply 
the following settings:
Change:
anonymous_enable=YES
write_enable=YES
anon_upload_enable=YES
ftpd_banner=Welcome to my local FTP service.
Append:
anon_other_write_enable=YES
anon_root=/home/ftp
anon_umask=0000

sudo service vsftpd restart

Create the build user/group:
	sudo groupadd build
	sudo useradd build -g build -m -s /bin/bash
  
Now let's create the directory required for the incoming packages:
release=lucid
sudo mkdir -m770 -p /home/ftp/incoming/$release/{apps,games}
sudo chown ftp:build  /home/ftp/incoming/$release/{apps,games}
	sudo mkdir -m755 -p /build/logs
	sudo chown -R build /build
